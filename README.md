MathFactCards
=============

Sample Android application that demonstrates 
how to use ViewPager and AsyncTask in conjunction
to load dynamic data into swipeable pages. 
Loading data in the background ensures that the
UI remains responsive even if the user is
swiping very fast.

This specific example loads number facts from 
this API http://numbersapi.com. But the same
principals shown here apply to loading any
data dynamically to be shown to the user.

This project also demonstrates in a basic way 
how to use 9-patch drawable resources in your
projects.
